					<span class="header">About Spitfire</span>
					Spitfire is a completely free and open source PHP framework desgined to make
					coding faster, more efficient and fun. The project is guided by Magic3W, a 
					small company focused on web development.

				<div class="column">
					<span class="header">Beware of the beta</span>
					At this time Spitfire is under heavy development and it's use in big production
					environments is discouraged.
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<span class="header">Spitfire for beginners</span>
					This software is not ready for beginners,
					we try to be as helpful as possible and to fix the bugs anybody who uses SF comes across 
					as quickly as we can. But you should know how to explain the
					bug correctly to us.
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<span class="header">Legal blah blah</span>
					Once you download or use Spitfire you assume the responsibility in case it 
					destroys your Hard drive or eats your dog. As far as we tested any of both
					should happen though.
